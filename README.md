Machine should have the following: 

[node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

Basic editor, for e.g. [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)

Compass ``gem install compass``.

* This project is generated with [angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular).
 
* Grunt is used for building and deployment on local, and it is hosted on Bitbucket server.
 
* For creating a single page application, I have relied upon AngularJS.
 
* UI/UX are supported using BootStrap
 
* Google Maps api is used to display parking location.
 
* Used Sublime Text as IDE.
